Important for the First Version:

* Write some unit-tests that offer larger "use-case stories" that allow for larger refactorings.
* Couch::docOpen - Handle error on loading unknown document.
* Couch::docRemove - Mark document class (id and revision) as deleted
* Couch_Document::fetchAllRevisions() and ::fetchRevision()
* Couch_TemporaryView::__construct - Language Key missing
* Couch_DocumentSet - Optional Max Storage Int where an auto update and removal of documents is done.
* Documentation for all classes and functions
* View, ViewRow and Response should implement ArrayAccess (Array Multi Access?)

Later Versions:

* Identiy Map for Documents: Phly_Couch::enableDocumentStorage(); ?? disable? other name?
* Big Todo: Attachments for Documents
* Reimplement a working Zend_Http_Client somehow
