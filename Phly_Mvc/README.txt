Phly_Mvc - an event manager based approach to MVC
=================================================

Inspired by Fabien Potencier's Symfony 2 presentation at PHP Quebec (and
talks individually with him), Phly_Mvc is an event-driven MVC
implementation. It utilizes Phly_PubSub internally, and in large part
leverages existing components from other frameworks.

Phly_Mvc takes a little more setup than many other PHP MVC
implementations. However, the benefits are greater flexibility, better
encapsulation, and an architecture designed to return a response as
early as possible.
